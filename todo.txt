Issue: Not able to know whether the build was succesfull or not 
       since the agent exits immediately after the docker build command since input is greater than token limit.
Solution: A function to call after build process which uses "echo $?" to know if the build was succesfull.

Issue: Need to check if the container from the image runs and have all the required dependencies.
Solution: need to figure out.
